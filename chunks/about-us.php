In contrast to other Indian eateries, Restro was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.

We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.

Restro has developed to incorporate four superb takeout areas in Shahbad Daulatpur with additional to come sooner rather than later. Our group takes pride in the way that we can furnish our new and faithful clients with extraordinary tasting Indian-roused nourishment that is not normal for that at some other Indian eatery you visit.
